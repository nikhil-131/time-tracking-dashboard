## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

I learned how to efficiently use semantic HTML5 markup to structure the content of the page. Additionally, I enhanced my skills in CSS, particularly in using flexbox and CSS grid for layout design. Incorporating a mobile-first workflow helped me ensure a responsive design across different devices. Moreover, working with React improved my understanding of building interactive web applications.
